<p>Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat, is the House Minority Leader and represents New York’s 8th congressional district, a district that encompasses most of western and southern Brooklyn. This election, he is running for his 7th term in office. Politically, Jeffries is moderately liberal, with many of his policies hewing closely to President Joe Biden’s administration’s positions.</p>

<p>Jeffries believes that the government should take a more direct role in expanding healthcare access. Jeffries has been a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act, and he pushed back on former President Donald Trump’s efforts to undo it.  He was also a major backer of the Inflation Reduction Act, which capped insulin prices for Medicare recipients and allowed Medicare to negotiate with drug companies for certain pharmaceuticals. He has signaled support for universal healthcare through cosponsorship of “Medicare for All” legislation.</p>

<p>Jeffries is supportive of immigration and immigrants. On his website, he proudly notes how diverse his district is, describing the country’s diversity as a “foundational model” and “what makes America a great country”. During his time in Congress, he has voiced support for many pro-immigrant pieces of legislation. He <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/schumer-jeffries-joint-statement-on-the-biden-administration-extending-tps-status-to-venezuelan-migrants">supported President Biden’s expansion of TPS (Temporary Protected Status) for Venezuelans</a> and cosponsored the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/16/all-actions">American Dream and Promise Act of 2023</a> which aims a path for many DACA recipients to gain permanent residency.</p>

<p>Congressman Jeffries supports continued funding to allies like Ukraine and Israel. On Ukraine, he has described the war as <a href="https://www.dems.gov/newsroom/press-releases/chairman-jeffries-on-msnbc-president-joe-biden-and-house-democrats-are-building-a-better-america-">“a battle between democracy and autocracy, between freedom and repressive government”</a> and was a major proponent of the aid package that passed this past April. Jeffries has long been considered a staunch supporter of Israel and supports continued military aid. However, he has recently <a href="https://youtu.be/nA8iuoRNQws?feature=shared&t=254">voiced concerns (albeit subtly) about their tactics and the death of Palestinians civilians in Gaza.</a>.</p>

<p>Criminal justice reform has long been an important policy area for Jeffries, who has called America’s high incarceration rate <a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/03/18/jeffries-armstrong-sentences-cocaine">a stain on our democracy"</a>. He sponsored <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4408">legislation that would ban police from using chokeholds</a> and supported the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/criminal-justice-reform-finally-has-chance-congress-here-s-what-n936866">First Step Act</a>, a law that, among other things, enables prisoners to gain time off their sentence by participating in rehabilitation programs.</p>
